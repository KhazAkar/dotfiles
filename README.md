# Dotfiles
Here's my personal dotfiles, but with a twist - very configurable and with great possibilities to extend everything

# Structure of setup scripts
It looks like this:
"setups/{category}/name/setup_{subcategory}/scriptfile.likeShorTclOrWhatever"

# Games category
I do NOT provide blobs for games, I just put placeholders. Everything will be in setup script for each game
